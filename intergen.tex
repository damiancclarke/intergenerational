  \begin{abstract}
    Targeted treatments of new-borns with delicate health stocks have been shown to have considerable returns in terms of survival and later life outcomes.  We seek to determine to what degree such treatments are reflected in later life health outcomes of treated individuals, and to what degree these are passed on to early life health outcomes of the \emph{subsequent} generation.  We follow three generations of linked microdata, and use a regression discontinuity design to study the impacts of targeted neonatal health policies based on birth weight assignment rules.  We estimate that...

  \section{Introduction}
  Returns to early life investment programs accrue over life.  For how long does this accrual last?  

  

  How long are returns to early life investment programs accrued?  Large public health programs focused on children with poor birth outcomes have been shown to result in immediate improvements in health and survival \citep{Almondetal2010}, which impact educational outcomes in childhood and adolescence \citep{Bharadwajetal2013}.  A broader literature suggests intergenerational transfers in education and well-being.  If neonatal and early life health programs spillover to future generations, this suggests that the already large benefits of such programs could be a (considerable) lower bound.


  ...
  
  We trace out impacts of an early life program through childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, and additionally follow impacted individuals into the next generation.  Linking comprehensive microdata registries, we are able to observe all births in Chile between 1992-2017, their full inpatient hospitalization history, and for those that go on to have \emph{their own} births, we observe the early life health stocks and hospitalization records for their own children.  We study ...

  \section{Data}
  Between 1992 and 2017 we observe x,xxx,xxx births occurring to x,xxx,xxx mothers.  Birth registries in Chile are universal, estimated to cover 99.9\% of all births [check cite DEIS].  Individuals are recorded using their national idendity number, assigned at birth. Data on these births are merged (using a masked version og the national identity number) with the hospitalization registry and the death registry, which cover all deaths and in-patient hospitalizations in the country.  In total, xx,xxx births are matched to a death record before the age of 1 year. This closely agrees with the average infant mortality rate reported over this time by the World Bank (which is 8.7 per 1,000 live births).\footnote{Note that there are x,xxx deaths which occur under 1 year of age in the death registry which are not observed in the birth registry. This will occur when a child arrives to the country after being born but does not survive up until 1 year.}  And in total xx,xxx births are observed to appear in the death registry at any point during this period.  Of all births, x,xxx,xxx are matched to at least one hospitalization, and in total xx,xxx,xxx hospitalizations are matched with births, implying that the average number of hospitalizations per matched birth is x.xx.  In Appendix \ref{app:data} we document tha match quality, observing that across registries individuals which are matched based on their unique national identity number are reported to have precisely the same birth date and sex.  In less than xx\% of the matches, we observe a reporting inconsistency.

  Of the births between 1992-2017, x,xxx,xxx (xx\%) are girls.  Of these, xx,xxx are observed to have \emph{their own} child in the birth registry.  This occurs when an individual who was born in an early year (say 1992) has a birth in a later year (say 2017, in which case she would be aged 25 years at the time of her own child's birth).  In Appendix \ref{app:data} (Table \ref{tab:birthChart}) we present the number of births from each year which went on to have a birth in the future.

  Tabular results from above.
  

  Could also add days of hospitalization at birth here following figure 1 (alternatively, could look at this in sub-section below, or as an appendix).
  
  \subsection{Longer-Term Health Outcomes of the First Generation}
  Let's look at health outcomes over the full life, as well as their dynamic nature.  Ie first look at total nights hospitalization.  Then look at effects by age (1 yr, 2 yrs, ...). This could be shown graphically with a single point estimate and CI per year.  Then break out and look at particular ICD classes (perhaps this is conditional on there being significant impacts on health)?
  
  
  \subsection{The Intergenerational Transmission of Health at Birth}

  Should start with an illustrative bin scatter \citep{Cattaneoetal2019} showing general patterns of intergenerational transmission.

  Then should look at birth outcomes: birth weight, gestation, size.  I think we should also look at impacts across the range of birth weight (and size?) distribution.  I can implement multiple hypothesis corrections for this.

  \subsection{Identification Checks}
  Checks of covariate balance of mothers and fathers [FIRST GENERATION!!]  (ie grandparents of our most recent generation).  Density manipulations checks.  Most recent iterations \citep{Cattaneoetal2020}, earlier iterations \citet{McCrary2008}.  Checks of bias induced by heaping \citep{Barrecaetal2016}.
