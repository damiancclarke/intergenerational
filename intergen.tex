  \begin{abstract}
    Targeted treatments of new-borns with delicate health stocks have been shown to have considerable returns in terms of survival and later life outcomes.  We seek to determine to what degree such treatments are reflected in later life health outcomes of treated individuals, and to what degree these are passed on to early life health outcomes of the \emph{subsequent} generation.  We follow three generations of linked microdata, and use a regression discontinuity design to study the impacts of targeted neonatal health policies based on birth weight assignment rules.  We estimate that...

  \section{Data}
  Between 1992 and 2017 we observe x,xxx,xxx births occurring to x,xxx,xxx mothers.  Birth registries in Chile are universal, estimated to cover 99.9\% of all births [check cite DEIS].  Individuals are recorded using their national idendity number, assigned at birth. Data on these births are merged (using a masked version og the national identity number) with the hospitalization registry and the death registry, which cover all deaths and in-patient hospitalizations in the country.  In total, xx,xxx births are matched to a death record before the age of 1 year. This closely agrees with the average infant mortality rate reported over this time by the World Bank (which is 8.7 per 1,000 live births).\footnote{Note that there are x,xxx deaths which occur under 1 year of age in the death registry which are not observed in the birth registry. This will occur when a child arrives to the country after being born but does not survive up until 1 year.}  And in total xx,xxx births are observed to appear in the death registry at any point during this period.  Of all births, x,xxx,xxx are matched to at least one hospitalization, and in total xx,xxx,xxx hospitalizations are matched with births, implying that the average number of hospitalizations per matched birth is x.xx.  In Appendix \ref{app:data} we document tha match quality, observing that across registries individuals which are matched based on their unique national identity number are reported to have precisely the same birth date and sex.  In less than xx\% of the matches, we observe a reporting inconsistency.

  Of the births between 1992-2017, x,xxx,xxx (xx\%) are girls.  Of these, xx,xxx are observed to have \emph{their own} child in the birth registry.  This occurs when an individual who was born in an early year (say 1992) has a birth in a later year (say 2017, in which case she would be aged 25 years at the time of her own child's birth).  In Appendix \ref{app:data} (Table \ref{tab:birthChart}) we present the number of births from each year which went on to have a birth in the future.

        Column 2 notes the number of births which match to each dataset.  In the
        case of the birth register, it refers to the number of births which match

        number of hospitalizations which match to each other database.  Note that
        in the case of births, the nuber of hospitalizations linked to births is not
        the same as the number of births linked to hospitalizations in the preceding
        column given that a single birth can be hospitalized multiple times.  Finally,
        column 4 notes the total number of deaths which are matched with births
